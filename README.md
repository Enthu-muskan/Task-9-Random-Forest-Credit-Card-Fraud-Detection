# Task-9-Random-Forest-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Dataset was generated using sklearn's make_classification function to simulate real-world imbalanced fraud data.

## Steps Performed
1. Generated imbalanced dataset
2. Checked class distribution
3. Split data using stratified sampling
4. Trained baseline Logistic Regression
5. Trained Random Forest model
6. Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score
7. Plotted feature importance
8. Saved trained model using joblib

## Outcome
Random Forest performed better than baseline model for detecting fraud cases.
